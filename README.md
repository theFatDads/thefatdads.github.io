# The Next Step
___
## Our Goal
When designing our submission for the Connecticut Tech Challenge, we wanted to attempt to help as many people who are involved with opioids as possible. We wanted to help those who are considering taking opioids, those who are currently taking opioids, and those who are abusing opioids.
## Our Direction
_The Next Step_ is a timeline-based information resource for providing users in Connecticut with data and resources to assist them with Opioids in every step of the process. 

We determined a timeline would be the best way of representing this process, as the usage of opioids should be a process, with a beginning and end.
